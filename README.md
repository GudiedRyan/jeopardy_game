# jeopardy_game
A project that will allow users to create Jeopardy games for fun.
Anyone will be able to make a game and save it, but only users will be able to make private games. Users will also find it easier to keep track of their games, as they will have a special account page with all their puzzles available.
Some additional features users will have access to include, but will not be limited to; the ability to edit or delete games, and the ability to save games as favorites.
